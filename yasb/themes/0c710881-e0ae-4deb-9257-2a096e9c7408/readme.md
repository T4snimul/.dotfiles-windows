A dark theme for YASB/Komorebi by kbuckleys

For a 1:1 result on your end, make sure you have the [JetBrains Font Family](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) installed.

UPDATE: Theme has been overhauled, featuring many refinements, weather widget and a fresh coat of paint using the [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/) Mocha color palette.

For the weather widget to work properly, make sure you obtain your own API key from [here](https://www.weatherapi.com/), then update the config.yaml file with your API key and location.
