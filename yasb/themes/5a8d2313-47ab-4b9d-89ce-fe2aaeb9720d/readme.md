A barebone theme for YASB/Komorebi by kbuckleys

The theme uses the 0xProto Nerd Font which you can find [here](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads). In addition, if you're on Windows 10, you'll run into an issue of missing icons most likely, unless you install the Segoe Fluent Icons font, which you can obtain [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/downloads/#fonts).
